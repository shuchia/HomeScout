 I want to build an apartment finder for young professionals who waste 20-40 hours on apartment hunting logistics -
 time they could spend investing, learning, or actually working at their new job. They're juggling spreadsheets, 
photos, appointments, and trying to remember which place had the good water pressure. The young professionals enter:
1. Their city
2. Budget
3. Bedrooms/Bathrooms 
4. Property Type
5. Move-In Date
5. Any other preferences

The app searches for apartments  and returns 10 recommendations with percentage match, a carousel of imagesi, and 2-4 
rent/month and a few other pieces of info each. What are 3 solutions starting with the simplest first? Include a solution that uses the Claude 
Messages API.
